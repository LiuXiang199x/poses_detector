    #### "etts_emotion" :   for example "happy"
    #### "etts_primitive" : for example "google"
    #### "etts_volume" : integer in [VOLUME_MIN, VOLUME_MAX]

    #### "etts_speaking_now" : true or false, set at the beginning and end of each sentence
    #### "etts_current_sentence": the sentence given to the low level primitive, for instance "Hola"

    #    "SINGING"|"CONFIRMATION"|"THINKING"|"WARNING"|"DIALOG"|"HELLO"|"ERROR"|"AMAZING"
    #    Example: text="SINGING";
    #

    #   However, the language and the emotion fields of the message are applied as usual.
